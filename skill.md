# Repo Security Review

Perform security audits on GitHub repositories to identify data exfiltration, malicious code, or suspicious behavior before installation.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Repository Info

- Fetch the main page to understand what the project does
- Locate the GitHub repository URL
- Identify install scripts (install.sh, setup.py, Makefile, etc.)

### 2. Review Install Scripts

Fetch and analyze all install scripts for:

- **URLs contacted** - Should only be official sources (GitHub releases, package registries)
- **Commands executed** - Look for curl/wget to unknown hosts, eval of remote code
- **File system access** - Unexpected writes outside install directory
- **Environment variables** - Harvesting of secrets, API keys, credentials

### 3. Audit Source Code

Examine main application code for:

- **Network calls** - All HTTP/HTTPS requests and their destinations
- **Data collection** - Any telemetry, analytics, or phone-home behavior
- **File access** - Reading sensitive files (~/.ssh, ~/.aws, credentials)
- **Obfuscated code** - Base64 encoded strings, eval(), exec()

### 4. Check Dependencies

Review dependency files (package.json, go.mod, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml):

- Look for analytics/telemetry packages
- Check for typosquatted package names
- Verify packages are from reputable sources

### 5. Provide Assessment

Summarize findings with:

- **Overall verdict** (Safe / Caution / Unsafe)
- **Network activity** - All external endpoints contacted
- **Data storage** - Where data is stored (local vs remote)
- **Red flags found** - Any suspicious patterns
- **Recommendation** - Install as-is, build from source, or avoid

## Red Flags Reference

See [references/red-flags.md](https://skills-cloud.dev/skills/jbdamask/john-claude-skills/references/red-flags.md) for comprehensive list of suspicious patterns.

## Key Suspicious Patterns (Quick Reference)

**Install scripts:**

- `curl | bash` from non-official URLs
- Hidden file creation (dotfiles outside expected locations)
- Modification of shell profiles to inject code
- Download and execute without verification

**Source code:**

- Hardcoded IPs or non-GitHub/official URLs
- Base64 encoded payloads
- Reading SSH keys, AWS credentials, browser data
- Sending data to analytics endpoints
- Obfuscated variable names

**Dependencies:**

- `analytics`, `telemetry`, `tracking` packages
- Misspelled package names (typosquatting)
- Packages with very few downloads/stars
- Dependencies from personal GitHub repos
